# Title: Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application


## Learning Objectives

You now know JavaScript well enough to write simple and complex frontend applications, saving data locally if needed, and querying an API as well. You know the language, and you know its power, but something is still missing. The code seems convoluted and all over the place. Is this really how established developers work, you may wonder?  
At the end of this challenge you will:

- be able to organize your code with multiple functions
- be able to organize your code in multiple files
- be able to use a package manager to import third-party libraries in your code
- be able to use linters and formatters to make your code cleaner and more bug-free
- be able to optimize your code to be shipped to a browser faster

## Your mission

Your Weather App feels pretty solid right now. It works, and it does its job well. But you want to publish the code publicly and use it to show your skills to potential employers. There is some work that needs to be done ðŸ¦¾



### Day 1 - Refactor



_Do you have time to spare? See if you can help someone, add "nice-to-have" features to your app, or refactor another app of yours!_

### Day 2 - JavaScript Modules

It's a lot of functions, in a long file. Guess what? In modern JavaScript, you can divide your code into multiple files for better organization, and import/export things (functions, variables, classes) from one file to another.


### Day 3 - Modules and the Browser


   _Hint: you may not need VS Code Live Server after all..._
